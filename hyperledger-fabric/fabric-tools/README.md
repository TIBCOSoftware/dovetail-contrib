# fabric-tools
This package is designed to support configuration and deployment of dovetail applications in public cloud services, including AWS, Azure, and IBM Cloud.  Since [IBM Blockchain Platform (IBP)](https://cloud.ibm.com/catalog/services/blockchain-platform-20) is currently the only public cloud environment that supports Hyperledger Fabric v1.4, we describe the deployment process for [marble-app](../marble-app) and [marble-client](../marble-client) for IBP only.

## Build and install fabric-tools
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail-contrib/hyperledger-fabric/fabric-tools
go install
fabric-tools help
```

## Create Hyperledger Fabric network in IBM Cloud
The [IBP Tutorial](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2) describes how to create a Hyperledger Fabric network in IBM Cloud, which involves the following steps:
1. Create IBM Cloud Kubernetes cluster, [IBP Tutorial (Step 4)](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2#step-4-create-ibm-cloud-services);
2. Build Fabric network using IBM Blockchain Platform console, [IBP Tutorial (Step 5)](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2#step-5-build-a-network), which includes:
* Create and start Certificate Authority (CA) servers for orderer and peer organizations;
* Create identities for organization administrators and peer/orderer nodes;
* Create MSP definitions for orderer and peer organizations;
* Create and start orderer and peer nodes;
* Define network consortium by adding organizations in an orderer;
* Create a channel, and join peers to the channel.

## Package and install/instantiate chaincode
Chaincode must be packaged as `cds` file to be installed in IBP.  We can package the [marble-app](../marble-app) chaincode using a local `cli` docker container, i.e.,
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail-contrib/hyperledger-fabric/marble-app
make package
```
Note that this command requires that you start the local `cli` docker container, or simply start all containers of the `first-network` sample network:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/hyperledger/fabric-samples/first-network
./byfn.sh up -s couchdb
```

If you do not want to start a local fabric sample network, you can use the `fabric-tools` to generate the `cds` file from chaincode source code, e.g., `/tmp/marble_app/marble_cc/src`, as follows.
```
mkdir -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/chaincode
cp -R /tmp/marble_app/marble_cc/src $GOPATH/src/github.com/chaincode/marble_cc
fabric-tools package -n marble_cc -v 1.0 -p $GOPATH/src/github.com/chaincode/marble_cc
rm -R $GOPATH/src/github.com/chaincode
```

You can then install and instantiate the resulting package, `marble_cc.cds` using the `IBP console` as shown in the [IBP Tutorial (Step 6)](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2#step-6-deploy-blockchainbean2-smart-contract-on-the-network).

## Prepare IBP network for client app
Download the connection profile of the instantiated `marble_cc.cds` as shown in the [IBP Tutorial (Step 7)](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2#step-7-connect-application-to-the-network).  Save the profile in the `scripts` folder, e.g., [scripts/ibpConnection.json](./scripts/ibpConnection.json).

In IBP Console, register a user with type of `client` in `Org1 CA` as shown in the [IBP Tutorial (Step 5)](https://github.com/IBM/blockchainbean2#use-your-ca-to-register-identities).  This user, e.g., `user1`, will be used by the [marble-client](../marble-client) to invoke the chaincode.

Execute the following script to create the network config and user crypto data for the client app:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail-contrib/hyperledger-fabric/fabric-tools/scripts
./setup-ibp.sh ibpConnection.json user1 user1pw
```
This script uses the connection profile and user and password specified in the above steps, so change them to match the names in your configuration.

Verify that a network-config-file, `config-ibp.yaml` is created, which will be used by the client app to connect to the IBP network.  A folder `crypto-ibp` should be created and it contains required crypto data, especially the private key and signing certificate of the client user, `user1`, which is in the folder, e.g., `crypto-ibp/organizations/org1msp/users/user1/msp`, and the `signing certificate` should be named as, e.g., `signcerts/user1@org1msp-cert.pem`.

Note that the setup script depends on the [fabric-ca-client](https://github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca), which must be installed in advance, i.e.,
```
go get -u github.com/hyperledger/fabric-ca/cmd/...
```

## Edit and build marble-client app
Use [TIBCO FlogoÂ® Enterprise v2.6](https://docs.tibco.com/products/tibco-flogo-enterprise-2-6-1) to edit the [`marble_client_app.json`](../marble-client/marble_client_app.json):

* Start Flogo Enterprise
```
cd $FLOGO_HOME/2.6/bin
./run-studio.sh
```
* Launch Flogo Console in Chrome at `http://localhost:8090`
* Open `Extensions` tab, and upload `fabclient` extension, [fabclientExtension.zip](../fabclientExtension.zip);
* Open `Apps` tab, create app named `marble_client_app` and import app with the file [`marble_client_app.json`](../marble-client/marble_client_app.json);
* Open the `marble_client_app` and click the `App Properties` link, update the value of `CLIENT_USER` to match the name of the user created in the previous step;
* Open `Connections` tab, edit and save the connector `local-first-network` to use configuration files `./scripts/config-ibp.yaml`, which is generated in the previous step, and [empty_entity_matchers.yaml](../testdata/empty_entity_matchers.yaml);
* Open `Apps` tab, export the `marble_client_app` and download the updated app to [`marble-client/marble_client_app.json`](../marble-client/marble_client_app.json).

Build and start the marble-client-app:
```
cd $GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail-contrib/hyperledger-fabric/marble-client
make create
make build
export CRYPTO_PATH=$GOPATH/src/github.com/TIBCOSoftware/dovetail-contrib/hyperledger-fabric/fabric-tools/scripts/crypto-ibp
make run
```
Note that the `CRYPTO_PATH` must be set to the crypto folder generated by the previous step.  To run the client app in a docker container, you can copy or mount this crypto folder in the docker container, and configure `CRYPTO_PATH` accordingly.

## Test marble-client app
The REST APIs, described in [`marble-client`](../marble-client#test-marble-client-app), can be used to test the `marble-client` with the chaincode `marble-app` instantiated in IBM Cloud.
